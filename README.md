I have been using computers since 98, I have experienced many things about computers as both hardware and software, I have used many different programs, so when I encounter something new, I can adapt very quickly.I learned C# and Unity  from videos and documents. After graduation, I take a course of JavaScript and learned JS and after that  I signed up another course for carrying my C# and .NET skills to next level.

Skills:  C#/.NET/REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning .NET
